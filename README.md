# Table_Custom

Dynamic Table with Totals
This repository contains a custom implementation of a dynamic table with the ability to add, remove, and edit rows. The table automatically calculates and updates the total values in the footer based on the data entered in the cells.

## Features

- Add and remove rows using buttons or keyboard shortcuts
- Edit cell values directly in the table
- Keyboard navigation for easy cell and row traversal
- Automatic calculation and update of total values
- Input validation and formatting for numeric cells
- Placeholder management for empty cells
- Modular and reusable code structure

## Getting Started

To use the dynamic table in your project, follow these steps:

1. Start interacting with the table:
   - Click on cells to edit their values
   - Use the "Add Row" and "Remove Row" buttons to manipulate rows
   - Navigate through cells and rows using arrow keys
   - Use the "Insert" key to add a new row and "Shift+Delete" to remove the current row

## Dependencies

The dynamic table implementation does not rely on any external libraries or frameworks. It is built using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
